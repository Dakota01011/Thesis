Log of stuff I did

KNN_accelerator.h driver in the design_1_wrapper_hw_platform_0 project had a macro call to Xil_Out21().
This function needs xil_io.h included but the design_1_wrapper_hw_platform_0 project forgot to add this.
BSP project generates code from wrapper_hw project and that is where is error is shown to be when it is really in wrapper_hw, NOT BSP.
Fix issue in wrapper_hw then use system.mss in BSP to Re-generate BSP sources.
Clean and rebuild.

Agent Ransack is a very helpful program for windows.

Currently having issues with bad_alloc when program is trying to fetch data from Dataset

cpp vectors seem to be throwing "terminate called after throwing an instance of 'St9bad_alloc' what():  std::bad_alloc"

Timing is making the current design difficult to get working.
New design idea:
Remove dataNameIn and use index to be decoded by ARM core
Rename loadRef to start
Remove refDataIn and shift all data using dataValueIn

ACLK is 100MHz so 10ns period.
32bit is 21.47 sec
64bit is years

large data sets cause cout to stop working.
switch to printf for all couts.

Dataset with 0:99 points with 10 dim. Results are all wrong. No obvious pattern.

Dataset with 0:10 points with 10 dim. Point #10 is not getting loaded into sort buffer before readout.
The rest of the readout seems to be correct, just shifted.

Last data point does not get put in sort because calculation stops after the last write because of the wr_en.
Need to continue calculations after last write.

Need to convert data file to hex(?) file to be added to project and hopefully dumped into readonly section of ram automatically.
Then look at memory view, if there is one, to make sure the values are loaded correctly. 
Then use DMA to pull data from memory and probe it on the AXI stream
